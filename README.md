# Basketball-Posture-corrector

BasketBallPoseEst.ipynb : Is a notebook to help show "good" or "bad" basketball poses for free throws. The .pdf file contains a project report for the work done in this notebook, and the work done on the web app.
PoseEstimation.ipynb : Jupyter notebook that uses opencv and MediaPipe to leverage the pose detection model to count number of bicep curls, and other fitness related exercises.

We created a web application using flask for creating a user interface that allows the user to upload a video/give the live camera feed. The website can show them if their posture is "Good"  or "Bad" and also uses Turtle graphics to show their form and the "ideal" form side by side for user's free throw posture improvement.
